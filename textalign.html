    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father 
        Howard Stark, tours in war-torn Afghanistan with his best friend and military liaison, James 
        Rhodes, to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed 
        by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings and Stark is gravely wounded by a missile used by the attackersâ€”one 
        of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive 
        and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from 
        reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a 
        Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word.</p>

    <h3>Cast</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:
        An industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons manufacturer for
         the U.S. military. Director Jon Favreau felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part and 
         that the actor could not only make Stark a "likable asshole," but also portray an authentic emotional journey, 
         once he had won over the audience. Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in Kiss Kiss 
         Bang Bang. Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, Shane Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man.</p>
